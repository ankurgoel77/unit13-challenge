* The final lamba function is located at [lambda_function.py](lambda_function.py)
* The validation code and the recommendation engine are both located in the recommend_portfolio() function
* All test cases pass, though there isn't a way to report it.
* The zip file for the bot is located at [RoboAdvisor_1_Bot_LEX_V1.zip](RoboAdvisor_1_Bot_LEX_V1.zip)
* I recorded a video of the bot located at [bot_test_video.mp4](bot_test_video.mp4).  I ran through the bot twice, first with all valid data, and then a second time with an age of 66 and investment amount of $4000.

* The output of the test cases is stored in text files as follows:
    * [age_error.txt](age_error.txt)
    * [correct_dialog.txt](correct_dialog.txt)
    * [incorrect_amount_error.txt](incorrect_amount_error.txt)
    * [negative_age_error.txt](negative_age_error.txt)
