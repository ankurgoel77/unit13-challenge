* The final lamba function is located at [lambda_function.py](lambda_function.py)
* The validation code and the recommendation engine are both located in the recommend_portfolio() function

    * [age_error.txt](age_error.txt)
    * [correct_dialog.txt](correct_dialog.txt)
    * [incorrect_amount_error.txt](incorrect_amount_error.txt)
